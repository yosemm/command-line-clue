I found The Librarian in the pond. I found a kitchen knife in the dock.
I followed the first clue and went to the cottage. In the cottage I found the Iron Poker and a second clue.

## Clues:

1. Detective's Initial Report:

According to The Clockmaker, there were unusual sounds coming from the cottage last night.
